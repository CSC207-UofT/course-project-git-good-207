## Principles of Universal Design

# Equitable Use

* In our app, every user is equal and no user has special privileges. We intend for all the app functions to be available for all users such as making and browsing posts. All users have same level of privacy and security in our app.
* Our design is also neutral and as appealing as possible to all users
* In the future, we could make our app comply even more with this principle by implementing a text-to-speech feature which can read out the recipes to the user if user has vision impairments

# Flexibility in Use

* Our program follows this principle since it is usable from the commandline and the web UI
* We also allow flexibility in how the user wants to view their feed by allowing them to filter their feed according to their preferences
* Possible way to make our program even more flexible would be to make it accessible on more platforms or make it an Android app

# Simple and Intuitive Use

* All instructions when accessing app features such as creating posts are as clear and straightforward as possible
* We made use of effective prompting as well as feedback such as "Post successfully created!" after task completion
* Options after logging in are clearly indicated

# Perceptible Information

* In the web UI, we organized the text so that "titles" would appear larger and easier to read on posts such as the subtitle of "Ingredients"
* Text is in a legible font and has a distinct contrast to the background so it's easy to read

# Tolerance for Error

* When completing tasks such as creating recipes or logging in, our app warns the user when there's an invalid input, and it gives the user the opportunity to try again
* In the future, to better comply with this principle, we could implement fail safe features such as "locking" the account after a certain number of login failures

# Low Physical Effort

* Our app definitely follows this principle because the user needs minimal physical effort to use the app, and we try to require as little unnecessary typing as possible when using it

# Size and Space for Approach and Use

* This principle is not very applicable to our program because the user probably just operates it on an electronic device by themselves, and there is not really an issue of physical posture or usage space that we can control with our app
* However, something to facilitate usage would be to use high contrast UI to allow user to see the text on the app from a distance

## Marketing the program

If we were to market our program, we would target teenagers, young and older adults because they are the ones who would most likely be interested in cooking and using recipes. Since they cook more, they are likely to contribute to the program by sharing recipes and get the most benefit from using the app. If we wanted to narrow down the target population, we could target people who "like to cook." However, we would most likely want to target a wider audience since it is also hard to determine who exactly "likes to cook," and it would be better to target people who are likely to cook because even those who don't particularly enjoy it have to eat and could benefit from browsing easy-to-follow recipes that cater to their taste.

## Program usage by other demographics

Our program is likely to be used by the majority of people since everyone has to eat and probably cook at some point, but the app would not be used as much by very young people and very old people who are unlikely to cook for themselves or be interested in sharing recipes. It would also not be used by disabled people who cannot cook and those who are blind since our application is displayed on a screen.
