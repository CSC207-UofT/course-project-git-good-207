# Specification

Our project is a recipe saving and sharing app where the user can create recipes and share their recipes to the world or their friends. The program home page is the user’s feed containing other people’s posted recipes as well as recipes suggested by the app based on past recipes that the user liked. The user can filter their recipe feed by cuisine, estimated cooking duration, meal, et cetera. They can follow other users, adding them as ‘following’ which would result in their posted recipes displaying on the user’s feed. The user can “like” and “comment” on recipes, and also share it to their followers. “Liking” the post saves that recipe to the user’s “Liked” list of recipes. The user can customize their personal profile where others can see their bio, created recipes, and saved recipes.
