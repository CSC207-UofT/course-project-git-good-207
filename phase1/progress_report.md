# Progress Report

## What has worked well so far
Through the implementation of dependency inversion, as well as entity, use case, controller, and user interface classes,
we feel that we have done an effective job in ensuring that our design adheres with both SOLID principles and clean
architecture. The choice of packaging by layers has been a significant contributor to making sure our design is effective
(as mentioned in the packaging section of the design document). Moreover, as in phase0, our design continues to allow us
to easily extend our database and user interface to more complex ones without requiring significant modification of lower level code.   

Additionally, utilizing GitHub tools such as pull requests and GitHub Issues, has ensured that everyone in the group
remains on the same page when it comes to program design, documentation, code style, and code organization.
We were effective in reviewing each other's pull requests, making suggestions, and resolving potential merge conflicts.
