## Individual Progress Report

### Glen
In Phase 2, I focused on bug extermination and increasing testing coverage. With the help of Shawn's inOut dummy I was able to test my UserProfileControler. Additionally, minor refactoring was done in UserManager. With the help of the team I also made the presentation according to what is expected on quercus. 

### Yolanda
In Phase 2, I improved post creation in Post Controller by taking care of more invalid input such as multiple-word ingredients and lack of spaces in ingredients.
I also refactored my code to reduce repetition using a helper. I edited and polished the Design Document in accordance with the TA feedback.
