## Individual Progress Report

### Glen
In Phase 2, I focused on bug extermination and increasing testing coverage. With the help of Shawn's inOut dummy I was able to test my UserProfileControler. Additionally, minor refactoring was done in UserManager. With the help of the team I also made the presentation according to what is expected on quercus.

### Yolanda
In Phase 2, I improved post creation in Post Controller by taking care of more invalid input such as multiple-word ingredients and lack of spaces in ingredients.
I also refactored my code to reduce repetition using a helper. I edited and polished the Design Document in accordance with the TA feedback.

### Eric
My main responsibility for phase 2 was creating our web UI using Angular. This was a large chunk of work, but I was able to get the UI nearly fully "functional" (i.e. I implemented all of the UI, but without any real business logic or real data, since we did not have enough time to expose a REST API from our Java app. I implemented a Feed with likeable posts, a post creation menu, a login/logout system, a user search bar with instant search (like Instagram's UI), a user profile page, and more.

### Sebastian
With respect with Phase 1 the changes I did for Phase 2 were involving the PostManager, Post, TestPostManager and MysqlController classes. In the first one having read the review from the TA on the phase 1, I notice that I could add more javadocs and improve the exceptions handling that was on the class. Similarly for TestPostManager I add more testcases in order to increase the coverage by trying to test each method at least once. On the other hand, for Post it was mostly related to javadocs likewise with MysqlController.
